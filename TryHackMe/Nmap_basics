## 🚀 Common Port Scanning Techniques

### 1. **TCP Connect Scan**
- Flag: `-sT`
- Full TCP handshake
- Easily detectable
- Use case: When SYN scans aren't permitted (e.g., due to restricted permissions)

### 2. **SYN Scan (Half-Open)**
- Flag: `-sS`
- Sends SYN and waits for SYN-ACK, but doesn't complete handshake
- Stealthier than `-sT`
- Default and most popular scan type

### 3. **UDP Scan**
- Flag: `-sU`
- Probes UDP ports
- Often slower due to no response on closed ports

## 🧪 Less Common (Advanced) Scan Types

### 4. **Null Scan**
- Flag: `-sN`
- Sends a packet with no TCP flags set
- Used to evade some firewalls
- May be ineffective on modern systems

### 5. **FIN Scan**
- Flag: `-sF`
- Sends a packet with only the FIN flag
- May bypass stateless firewalls

### 6. **Xmas Scan**
- Flag: `-sX`
- Sends a packet with FIN, PSH, and URG flags set (lights up like a Christmas tree)
- Similar use case as FIN/Null scans

## 📂 NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine)

### 🔍 What is NSE?
- A powerful feature of Nmap that allows custom script-based scanning
- Scripts are written in **Lua**

### 📌 Usage:
```bash
nmap --script <script-name> <target>
nmap --script-help <script-name>
🔍 Script Categories:
auth – authentication bypass scripts
vuln – check for known vulnerabilities
exploit – active exploitation
discovery – gather additional host/network info
malware – check for infections, backdoors
🔍 Example Commands:
nmap -sV --script vuln 192.168.1.100
nmap --script-help http-enum
nmap -p 80 --script http-title, http-methods scanme.nmap.org
🧠 Key Takeaways
Use -sS whenever possible for speed and stealth.
UDP scanning is essential for full coverage but slower.
Use -T4 or -T5 timing options to control speed.
NSE scripts extend Nmap from simple port scanning to full-blown security auditing.
You can search for scripts with:
locate *.nse | grep <keyword>
